function [ expInfo, maxNTrial ] = readExpInfo( cribSheetPath, varargin )
% readExpInfo - Read in trial meta data from a crib sheet to be able to e.g. load data in big analysis loop or load specific data into Matlab. 
% We assume the following:
%   - the sheet is an excel file and it needs to have the following format 
%     (column headers): 
%     - filePath (full path to data) 
%     - animal(animal ID as 'rXXX' or 'mXXX') 
%     - trialName ('setFileName' w/o extension)
%     - experiment_ID (numeric index that uniquely identifies experiments within animals)
% 
% Note that when no arguments are passed we will open a UI dialogue to find sheet on disk
%
% Usage:    expInfo = readCribsheet
%           expInfo = readCribsheet( cribSheetPath );
%           expInfo = readCribsheet( cribSheetPath, method )
%           expInfo = readCribsheet( cribSheetPath, method, 'inputName', inputVal, .. etc .. )
%
% Inputs:   cribSheetPath - full path to file (including name & extension) 
%           method        - string; defines how data is read; 
%                           'single' (read each line of sheet individually, i.e. no grouping) - default
%                           'singleTrial' (read 1 specific trial - needs additional params to work)
%                           'exp' (read full sheet and group by animal + experiment_ID) 
%                           'singleExp' (read 1 specific experiment - needs additional params to work)
%           varargin      - name-value: comma separated list of name-value pairs
%
%
% Outputs:  
%           expInfo   - structure with meta data 
%           maxNTrial - max trial number in any experiment (good to know for pre-allocation)
